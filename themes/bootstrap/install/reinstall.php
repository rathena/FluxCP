<h2>Re-Install Database Schemas</h2>
<p>You may re-install your database schema files (*.sql files) from this interface. If you are absolutely sure you want to proceed with this then click "continue".</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> By doing so, you may end up with duplicate indexes on your MySQL tables, but they are not harmful (this feature is highly experimental).</p>
